# PROGRESS (living checklist — agents tick items; orchestrator resumes from here)

Legend: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[!]` blocked (say why in Notes)

## Resume instructions (for a fresh orchestrator session)
1. Read `CLAUDE.md`, this file, `docs/07_PHASES.md`.
2. `git status` / `git log --oneline` to see the last checkpoint.
3. Spawn the next phase whose box is not `[x]`, following the order in 07. A1 ∥ B0 may run in parallel; so may A2 ∥ B1 and A3 ∥ B2.
4. Implementation agents run on the Opus model. The orchestrator only plans, reviews reports, and commits.

## Recovery after an interrupted agent (usage limit, crash)
An interrupted agent loses its conversation, not its files. To resume a phase that is `[~]` or has
unticked items but files present:
1. `git status` — uncommitted files are partial work from the interrupted run; keep them, do not
   assume they are complete.
2. Trust the tree and the tests over this checklist: run the phase's verification commands
   (pytest / flutter analyze+test+build) and read the existing files before writing anything.
3. Finish only what is missing; tick items here as you verify them; commit + push per milestone.
4. Spawn prompt for the resuming agent: "Resume phase <id>: read CLAUDE.md, docs/07_PHASES.md §<id>,
   docs/PROGRESS.md; inspect the tree; run the verification; complete the remaining items."

## Deviations from spec (record here)
- **A1** Routers are mounted twice: at `/api/v1` (the 04 base) **and** at the root, so the bare
  verification URLs in 07 (`GET /weather/snapshot?...`) work with curl. No contract change.
- **A1** `core/db.py` and `core/security.py` (listed in 05 §Layout) are **not** written yet — they
  belong to A2's DB/JWT work and were left out to avoid a collision.
- **A1** `Snapshot.derived` carries nine extra blocks beyond the ten named in 04
  (`sun, uv, wind, rain, soil, rainfall_outlook, storm_fog, sea, humidity`) so A2's builders can
  read card `data` straight out of the snapshot. Additive only.
- **A1** `imd_ids.json` has station ids for 35 cities but every `district_id` is `null` — IMD does
  not publish them and every endpoint 401s until the host is whitelisted. `providers/imd.py` skips
  the call when the id is missing.
- **A1** `/locations/popular` returns up to 120 curated cities (04 asks for ≥ 40); 106 are flagged
  `popular` in `cities.json`.

## Notes for next phase

### B0/B1/B2/B3 — Gradle inside the agent sandbox (orchestrator note, 2026-09-07 01:55)
`flutter build apk --debug` failed with `java.io.IOException: Unable to establish loopback connection`.
Verified cause: inside the tool sandbox Java NIO `Selector.open()` and `Pipe.open()` fail while plain
sockets work, so Gradle (and the Kotlin daemon) cannot start. **Run every Gradle/APK/`flutter run`
-on-Android command with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`.** Web build, analyze and test are fine
sandboxed. Toolchain on disk is complete: Flutter 3.47.2 stable, JDK 17, Android SDK (platform-tools,
platforms, build-tools, licenses) under `D:\sdk`; `app/build/web` was produced successfully.

### A2 (engine + /home) — what A1 hands you
**Get a Snapshot:**
```python
from app.services.snapshot import get_snapshot          # cached 5 min per (lat2dp, lon2dp, scenario)
snap = await get_snapshot(lat, lon, scenario="live", now=None, admin_warnings=None)
```
`now` (demo clock) or `admin_warnings` bypass the cache automatically. `build_snapshot()` is the
uncached variant. It raises `app.core.errors.NoDataError` (503) when Open-Meteo is down.

**Module map** (all under `backend/app/`):
`config.py` · `state.py` (global `demo_state.scenario` / `.now_override`, A3 drives it) ·
`core/{cache,timeutil,geo,i18n,errors}.py` · `providers/{base,open_meteo,bigdatacloud,rainviewer,imd,cpcb,tomtom,scenarios}.py` ·
`services/{snapshot,locations,aqi_cpcb,comfort,marine,visibility,workout,school_commute,commute,frost,packing,planting,tides,pollen,nowcast,flight_risk,warnings,util}.py` ·
`api/{health,locations,weather}.py` · `schemas/{location,warning,snapshot}.py`.
Add `core/db.py`, `core/security.py`, `models/`, `engine/`, `api/{auth,me,places,home,events}.py`.

**Card data → snapshot keys.** Most `data` blocks in 02 are already computed:

| card | source |
|---|---|
| current_conditions / hourly_forecast / daily_forecast / extended_forecast | `snap.current`, `snap.hourly` (48 h), `snap.daily` (16 d) |
| aqi | `snap.air_quality` (CPCB scale, `hourly[24]`) |
| pollen · tides · traffic | `snap.pollen` · `snap.tides` · `snap.traffic` — all `source: "estimated"` |
| warnings · nowcast | `snap.warnings` (merged + filtered + severity-sorted) · `snap.nowcast` |
| sea_conditions / water_temp | `snap.derived["sea"]` (present only when `snap.marine`) |
| comfort_index · heat_alert · humidity · uv_index · wind · sun_times | `derived["comfort"|"heat"|"humidity"|"uv"|"wind"|"sun"]` |
| best_workout_window · school_commute · commute_conditions | `derived["workout"|"school_commute"|"commute"]` |
| frost_alert · soil_moisture · rainfall_outlook · planting_guidance | `derived["frost"|"soil"|"rainfall_outlook"|"planting"]` |
| visibility · storm_fog_alert · rain_alert · travel_alerts · packing_suggestions | `derived["visibility"|"storm_fog"|"rain"|"flight_risk"|"packing"]` |

Still to build in A2: `radar` (call `/weather/radar`), `saved_places` (fan out snapshots),
`rain_probability` (needs `event_date`), `health_advisory` (compose from aqi/uv/humidity/heat/pollen).
Every derived block also carries a `urgency` float computed per the 02 rules — use it or override it.

**Gotchas found in A1**
- Open-Meteo's CAMS **pollen fields are `null` for every Indian coordinate** (confirmed in
  `tests/fixtures/air_*.json`; London returns real values). The monthly estimator is the normal
  path — always show the "Estimated" chip.
- Open-Meteo **visibility is metres** (converted to km in `normalize_forecast`) and **CO is µg/m³**
  (converted to mg/m³ for CPCB). `daylight_duration` seconds → `daylight_minutes`.
- Marine returns **HTTP 200 with `wave_height: null`** inland (not 400 as 05 assumed) — both cases
  are handled and map to `marine: null`, `tides: null`, no `derived["sea"]`.
- IMD returns `401 "Your IP/Domain <ip> needs to be whitelisted"`. `providers/imd.py` marks itself
  unavailable for 10 min after the first 401 and returns `None`. `/health` shows the status.
- `derived["storm_fog"]` is `None` when there is no hazard — gate the card on it.
- All times are ISO-8601 with the **location's** offset. Use `core.timeutil.iso/parse_any/tz_for`;
  `tzdata` is a pinned dependency because Windows has no system tz database.
- `zoneinfo` + `cachetools` + `respx` are pinned in `requirements.txt` / `requirements-dev.txt`.

**Tests**: `backend/.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest -q` → 210 passed, fully offline. `tests/conftest.py`
replays `tests/fixtures/*.json` through respx and fails on any unmocked host; add new upstreams there.
Re-record with `.venv/Scripts/python scripts/record_fixtures.py` (hits the real APIs).
